# Quick Start

Currently, Standard SDK is implemented only as a JavaScript module. However, its functionality could be implemented in other popular languages. If you would like to contribute to creating a Standard SDK in another language, please start a [discussion](https://github.com/comake/standard-sdk-js/discussions).

To get started with Standard SDK in Node.js, install the module with npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install @comake/standard-sdk
```

or

```shell
yarn add @comake/standard-sdk
```

To use Standard SDK in a browser, you'll need to use a bundling tool such as Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, or Browserify. Some bundlers may require a bit of configuration, such as setting `browser: true` in rollup-plugin-resolve.
