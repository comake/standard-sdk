Standard SDK is an open source software package that provides you with a single SDK to integrate and interact with any API. It vastly simplifies developer experience when building applications, especially ones which require interaction with multiple external APIs.

Developers commonly spent lots of time installing SDKs, reading documentation, and figuring out how to use each SDK to build integrations using APIs and to add features to their application. Instead of going through this time consuming process installing and learning many different SDKs, a developer can just install Standard SDK to build any integration their application requires. In addition to saving time, removing dependencies on all those SDKs in favor of just one can reduce your application's build size, and make it easier to onboard developers to your codebase.

See the [Standard SDK Documentation](https://comake-1.gitbook.io/standard-sdk/) to learn how it works and how you can use it today!
